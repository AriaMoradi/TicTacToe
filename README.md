# TicTacToe
This is my first real project on git and github.
this project is as it's title says is TicTacToe.
This game is a command Line/Terminal based interface game.

I use Code::Blocks 16.01 MINGW on Windows at this time, 
so you can import this project on your Windows use GCC as compiler.
Unfortunately The code is losing it's Cross-platform abilities.

At this time i am including windows.h and using system("cls") and system("delay x") you shouldc change the code to make it compile on GNU/Linux.
