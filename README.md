# TicTacToe
This is my first real project on git and github.
this project is as it's title says is TicTacToe.
This game is a command Line/Terminal based interface game.

I use Code::Blocks 16.01 MINGW on Windows at this time, 
so you can import this project on your Windows or GNU/Linux and use gpp as compiler.
